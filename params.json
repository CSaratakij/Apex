  "body": "# Apex\r\nApex is mainly build to act as a load balancer and to route traffic to the desired backend server with the capability to select between multiple balancing algorithms. Through the simplicity of the config file you can set it up really quick and it just works.\r\n\r\nA cool feature is that you can add or remove backend server through a very simple RESTful API and that these servers are automatically removed or added live to the load balancer\r\nand are directly accessible and usable.\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n- built on top of [netty](https://github.com/netty/netty)\r\n- high performance\r\n- load balancing\r\n- multiple strategies (round robin, random, least connections, fastest)\r\n- dynamic server adding/removing (simple RESTful API)\r\n- health check (ping probe, interval configurable in ms)\r\n- offline/online server management (removing and adding back to the LB)\r\n- configurable threads (recommended value is cpu cores * 2)\r\n- logging (debug logging configurable)\r\n- simple but powerful\r\n\r\n# Apex config\r\n\r\nVery simple but neat config format based on my project [Cope](https://jackwhite20.github.io/Cope/).\r\n\r\nAvailable balance strategies are:\r\n\r\n| Strategy  | Description |\r\n| --------- | ----------- |\r\n| ROUND_ROBIN | Typical round robin algorithm |\r\n| RANDOM | Random based selection |\r\n| LEAST_CON | The one with the least amount of connections |\r\n| FASTEST | The one with the fastest connection time |\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n# The first timeout value is read timeout\r\n# and the second one is write timeout\r\n# Both are in seconds\r\ngeneral:\r\n    debug true\r\n    server 0.0.0.0 80\r\n    backlog 100\r\n    threads 4\r\n    timeout 30 30\r\n    balance ROUND_ROBIN\r\n    probe 5000\r\n\r\n# How the RESTful API should be accessible\r\n# It is recommended to not bind this to 0.0.0.0\r\n# or to a specific external interface\r\nrest:\r\n    server localhost 6000\r\n\r\n# Here are all your backend servers\r\nbackend:\r\n    api-01 172.16.0.10 8080\r\n    api-02 172.16.0.11 8080\r\n    api-03 172.16.0.12 8080\r\n    api-04 172.16.0.13 8080\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Apex RESTful API\r\n\r\nThe API consists of two simple GET paths with path variables.\r\n\r\n| Path  | Example | Description |\r\n| --------- | ----------- | ----------- |\r\n| /apex/add/{name}/{ip}/{port} | /apex/add/web-01/172.16.0.50/80 | Adds the given backend server to the load balancer |\r\n| /apex/remove/{name} | /apex/remove/web-01 | Removes the given backend server from the load balancer |\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nLicensed under the GNU General Public License, Version 3.0.\r\n",
